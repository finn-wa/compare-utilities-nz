## To Do

- Calculate gas prices
- Add other Electric Kiwi plans
- Get full set of Frank data with script perhaps
- Get old Electric Kiwi power bills and calculate the ratios for each rate. Then calculate the power bill given those ratios rather than actual hourly usage.
- Calculate the best combination of plans for gas & electricity
